## Some Possible Ph.D. topics within the PLS group

Bigraphical Programming Languages:
Starting with the Bigraphical Programming Languages project joint with
Robin Milner, there have been a series of research projects affilliated
to the PLS group researching the design of

a framework for construction and analysis of domain-specific models and
programming languages based on the theory of bigraphs. The efforts have
resulted in several PhD thesis extending the
[[1](http://www.bigraph.org) theory of bigraphs and tools for editing
and exploring bigraphical models].

Possible Ph.D. topics include investigations into applications of bigraphs to
cyper-physical computing, business process
modelling, systems biology and model-driven software engineering;
development of tool support for
(semi-)automatic verification of properties of bigraphical models; and
extensions to the theory of bigraphs, e.g. type systems and quantitative
analysis.

Modular Reasoning about Software:
The goal of our research on modular reasoning about software is to
develop
theories and methods for modular reasoning about software written in
modern
programming languages. The purpose is to lay the foundation for
improvement
of software tools, which are being and will be developed over the next
five
to ten years and which will be used to improve software practice.

Possible Ph.D. topics include modular reasoning about shared heap
objects
(e.g., using variants of higher-order separation logic), parametricity
for low-level code, and modular reasoning about higher-order store.
Tools and Methods for Scalable Software Verification:
The goal of this research project is to develop tools for practical
verification
of modern object-oriented software written in Java / C#. The project
will
be based on earlier developments in separation logic to reason about
shared
heap objects and on static analysis techniques, in particular abstract
interpretation.

Possible Ph.D. topics include developments of separation logic for
reasoning about
delegates, generics and inheritance; specification and verification of
the C5 collection library; development and implementation of tools based
on
abstract interpretation.

Logical Frameworks:
The logical framework group is concerned with the development and
implementation of meta-languages for advanced data structures as well
as
tools for programming with and reasoning about them. Those data
structures
include not only lists and trees (including abstract syntax trees) but
also
more complex data structures for the meaning of programs and the meaning
of
mathematical proofs. The main activities of the group focus on the
development of the Twelf proof assistant, the functional programming
language Delphin, digital libraries for mathematical knowledge, meta
logics for LF and LLF, proofs by logical relations, logic programming,
proof planning by proof abstraction, and complexity analysis of logic
programs. A small but by no means complete list of ideas for doctoral
theses include the meta theory of concurrent systems (such as CLF),
meta
reasoning by coinduction, disproving false conjectures, and complexity
analysis of CLF programs.
Concurrency Theory and Applications:
There is an active group of researchers focusing on concurrency theory
and applications within the PLS, focusing on behavioural (session)
types, operational and denotational semantics of concurrent processes
and applications within security, web-services, business processes and
workflow.

The research is founded in the theory of process calculi, types,
categorical models for concurrency and verification.

Models for guarded recursion:
This project investigates type theories with delay operators and guarded
recursive types and terms, with the aim of providing the
foundation for extensions of proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.
These extensions should be useful in two ways: as a new type system
for programming with infinite structures, using the delay operators to
provide a guarantee of termination
expressible in types, and to allow for models of advanced programming
languages to be constructed using solutions to guarded recursive type
equations.

We study these type theories primarily using models constructed in
category theory.

This is a theoretical project in the intersection between programming
language theory and foundations of mathematics.
