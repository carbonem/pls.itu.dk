Welcome to the homepage of the **Programming, Logic and Semantics group at
ITU**. The PLS group is one of the seven research groups at ITU (for the
others, please visit the [research
section](http://en.itu.dk/Research/About-ITUs-Research/Research-Groups)
of ITU\'s homepage).

### Description

The PLS group conducts research in the theory of programming languages and logic. The aim of this research is to provide the tools allowing for future software to be safe, reliable and trustworthy, and the compentences of the group span from mathematical modelling and reasoning to implementation of tools. The research interests of the group currently span the following areas: Logics for reasoning about programming languages, programming language design, proof assistants, type theory, denotational semantics, concurrency and security as well as applications of these topics to digital elections, business process modeling and other topics.
