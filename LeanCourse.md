### Description

Lean is an interactive theorem prover that largely shares its logical foundations with Coq, but in which quite different design decisions have been made. Lean has attracted a substantial user base of mathematicians, and it has already been used both to construct a large library of mathematics (over one million lines) and a number of other results, including a successful formalization of Scholze's liquid tensor experiment and a proof of the existence of sphere eversions.

At the same time, Lean is a general-purpose pure functional programming language with dependent types. It is a sufficiently capable language that its compiler is written in Lean itself. Lean is also used as the language in which proof automation is implemented. As a programming language, Lean has innovative approaches to memory management, structuring monadic code, metaprogramming, and embedded languages.

This mini-course will situate Lean in both the landscape of theorem provers and the landscape of functional programming languages, and demonstrate proving, programming, and metaprogramming, all from a computer science perspective. The sections on programming and metaprogramming will also be relevant to those who have no interest in interactive theorem proving, and won't assume prior knowledge of Coq, Agda, Idris, or similar systems.
