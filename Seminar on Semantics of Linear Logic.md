### Suggested references

#### Domain theory:

-   Outline of a mathematical theory of computation (Scott 1970) is
    probably the best starting point,
-   Continuous Lattices (Scott 1971) provides the domains constructions;
-   Data types as lattices (Scott 1976) shows that there is a semantics
    of lambda-calculus (in fact PCF) in the domain of subsets of natural
    numbers (hence it provides a model of reasonable size)
-   Stable models of the typed lambda-calculus (Berry 1978) introduces
    the notion of stability \[it might be quite difficult to get your
    hands on it, you can just ask Thomas for a copy of it\].
-   Towards a mathematical semantics for computer languages (Scott and
    Strachey 1971)

#### Normal functors:

-   Normal functors, power series and the lambda-calculus (Girard 1988).
    Note that it uses old category theory terminology and a modernised
    version would be much easier to read
-   Two applications of analytic functors (Hasegawa 2002); this is a
    more recent paper in which one can find details about the analytic
    functors model of lambda-calculus.
