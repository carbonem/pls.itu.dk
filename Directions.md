### From Main Station (Hovedbanegården)

<span style="line-height: 1.5">Take the bus direction
"Nøragersmindevej". Get of at station "Hørgården". As I have never
taken the bus to the University, I don't know where the bus stop is
located. Our building is the one north of the DR Byen, the headquarters
of the DR.</span>

### From Kongens Nytorv

Take the metro M1 direction "Vestamager". Get of at station Islandsbrygge. <span style="line-height: 1.5">When you come out of the metro station, go right for about 700 meters. To your right you se a large body of water, once you have crossed it, take another right, follow the water pool until the first car bridge. You are standing in front of the building.</span>

### From the Airport
Take the train direction København main station for two stops. Get off at "Ørestad". Take the metro M1 towards "Vanløse". Get off at DR Byen/University. The fare for this trip is "2 zones" (1 zone is ca. 11 dkk). <span style="line-height: 1.5">When you are still at the platform, spot a group of [big buildings](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2183/1571054488_b153371833_b.jpg), no longer under construction, on the right hand side (when heading towards the original train direction). Go down from the station towards these buildings, pass under the bridge connecting the two sides of the group. IT University can be found behind, by a small water channel. The trip takes around 30 minutes, including the 5 minutes walk.</span>
  A taxi fare from the airport to ITU should be about 200 dkk, and takes roughly 15 minutes.
